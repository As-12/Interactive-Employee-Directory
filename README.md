## Description

Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other. This project leverages Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. The project is written in OOP style vanilla ES6.

This is my training project with Team treehouse bootcamp.
